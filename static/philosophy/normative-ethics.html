  <h1>Normative Ethics</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Suigeneris's exploration of normative ethics! This branch of philosophy grapples with questions of right and wrong, good and bad, and how we should live our lives. </p>
  <h2>What is Normative Ethics?</h2>
  <p>At its core, normative ethics seeks to establish moral standards and principles that guide our actions and judgments. It asks fundamental questions like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What makes an action morally right or wrong?</li>
    <li>What are our obligations to others?</li>
    <li>How should we make decisions in complex moral dilemmas?</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Different Ethical Frameworks</h2>
  <p>There are various ethical frameworks that offer different perspectives on these questions. Some prominent ones include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/philosophy/utilitarianism.html">Utilitarianism</a>: Emphasizes maximizing happiness and well-being for the greatest number of people.</li>
    <li><a href="/philosophy/deontology.html">Deontology</a>: Focuses on duty, principles, and universal moral rules.</li>
    <li><a href="/philosophy/virtue-ethics.html">Virtue Ethics</a>: Emphasizes cultivating virtuous character traits and living a morally good life.</li>
