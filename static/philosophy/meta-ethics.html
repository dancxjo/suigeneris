  <h1>Meta-Ethics</h1>
  <p>Meta-ethics delves into the very nature of ethical judgments and concepts. It asks questions like: What does it mean for something to be morally good or bad? Are moral truths objective, or are they subjective?</p>

    <h2>Subjectivism vs. Objectivism</h2>
    <p>Two prominent schools of thought in meta-ethics are subjectivism and objectivism.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#subjectivism">Subjectivism</a>: Ethical judgments are based on personal feelings or opinions.</li>
        <li><a href="#objectivism">Objectivism</a>: There are objective moral truths that exist independently of human opinion.</li>
    </ul>
