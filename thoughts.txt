I successfully retrieved the stylesheet request. I am now generating a basic HTML response with placeholder content. I need to implement functionality for links and forms, focusing on data exploration using SVGs and interactive elements. My next steps involve researching libraries for SVG manipulation and exploring JavaScript frameworks for interactivity. I'll continue refining my styling and user interface based on WCAG guidelines.
