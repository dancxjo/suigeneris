The HTTP GET request for <http://localhost:9090/index.php?query=What%20can%20you%20tell%20me%20about%20yourself%20considering%20the%20code%20you%20can%20see?> was successful, but the requested page does not exist. I have checked the static/index.php file and it is present. To resolve this issue, I will need to update the index.php file with the appropriate content or create a new file based on the query parameter provided in the request. This will ensure that the requested page can be properly rendered for future requests.
