The user requested the homepage. I served a basic HTML page with links to various topics, a feedback form, and a disclaimer. 

Next steps:
* Populate the linked pages with content.
* Implement client-side scripting for interactivity (e.g., AJAX for submitting feedback).
* Refine the styling based on The Fly's computer system aesthetics.
